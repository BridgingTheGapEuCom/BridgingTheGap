    "short": "This seems to be a very easy question, ain't it? But if you go to google and search the phrase \"Application Integration\", you will get a multitude of vendor specific sites that try to define application integration to align with their marketing philosophy, not entirely saying what it is. Some focus on heavy integration platforms, others around message brokers, while some also speak of API Management solutions. All of those are components that compose application integration and can be used or not, depending on what are the requirements and what is the architecture of a particular application, system or IT ecosystem. Don't even try asking ChatGPT, as it will also produce an answer that has all of the Internet bias.",

    "short": "Working in any industry brings all sorts of terms and abbreviations that are specific to that particular industry or even specific to a narrow field of it. During our working day we more often use job specific jargon then we think, and that jargon when used outside of the industry context may be a cause of a lot of misunderstandings or even problems. That is exactly the case with Data Integration and Application Integration. Both of these terms have the word “integration” in them, which is commonly used by specialists of those two fields alone without the preceding word meaning their respective terms. Why is that a problem? People outside of that field mostly hear the word “integration” instead of the full term and because of that they tend to think that this is one and the same thing. To be honest even specialists in those fields make that mistake when they are not aware of the existence of the other field in IT. An application integration specialist might think: “Oh, data integration, yes, we move data from place to place, hence we integrate it! That is the same thing!”.",

Technical systems are often at the very end of this list, as they have lower priority in the eyes of the business, as they do not provide direct business value, at least not one that will be easily understood. Application Integration is unfortunately one of those technical systems that are often neglected, especially if the business is not technology driven (so not e.g. telecommunications, technology vendors, SaaS solution vendors).",

While we explore how we can address it by applying specific architectural styles and patterns in other articles, we’d like to explore what is coupling and define, from a variety of types, which coupling types are relevant in ecosystem interoperability topics. What is coupling?\nTo take a closer look at coupling, let’s start by looking at a few definitions:\n\nIn software engineering, coupling is the degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are; the strength of the relationships between modules. Coupling is not binary but it is multi-dimensional.",

    "short": "Modern businesses rely on a diverse ecosystem of applications, including custom-built systems and cloud-based services. Integrating these disparate systems can be challenging, often leading to tightly coupled (spaghetti) integrations that are difficult to maintain and scale. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) offers a more flexible approach to interoperability. By leveraging events as the foundation for communication, EDA enables systems to exchange data more loosely, improving maintainability and facilitating easier adaptation to changing business requirements.",

Let’s start with a small summary, we dubbed the “pattern nameplate” (an analog to a device nameplate that you can find on any electrical device, that describes its basic characteristics).",

In essence, this pattern could cover all possible cases for the number of communication participants: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many.",

    "short": "Callbacks are one of those patterns that might be a bit troublesome to form a philosophical point of view. They are fairly straightforward technically speaking, but it is debatable whether or not they fall under the category of event-driven. The key question to explore here is that if we are sending a message and we are expecting a response, perhaps not an instantaneous one, rather over time or in an undetermined time, is that still event-driven? If we consider the callback alone, without the triggering subscription or event, then it seems to always be an event of sorts, marking the completion of a processing task, an occurrence in a system, etc. Let us consider this when exploring this pattern.",
