Together, we will explore the critical topic of \"The IT Talent Trap.\"\n\nIn today's rapidly shifting job market, both companies and candidates are facing significant challenges. Companies struggle to source the best talent, often ending up with candidates who excel at navigating Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and processes rather than being the ideal fit. Meanwhile, professionals are finding it increasingly difficult to secure stable positions.\n\nIn this session, we will deep-dive into the current challenges in IT recruitment and how to work with a broken process. We aim to shed light on these obstacles, offering valuable perspectives for both employers struggling to find the right people and candidates seeking to navigate the job market more effectively. We'll explore advice for candidates on how they can help themselves find better roles and overcome these pervasive problems.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to gain a broader perspective on the dynamics of IT talent acquisition and empower yourself with the knowledge to make informed decisions, whether you're hiring or seeking your next role.\n\nAt Bridging the Gap, we believe in the power of open collaboration and community-driven learning to democratize access to essential education.
