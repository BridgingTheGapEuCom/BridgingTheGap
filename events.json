Half British, half Polish, and living in Poland, Phillip brings a unique perspective on both the international and local recruitment landscapes.\n\nIn today's rapidly shifting job market, both companies and candidates are facing significant challenges. Companies struggle to source the best talent, often ending up with candidates who excel at navigating Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and processes rather than being the ideal fit. Meanwhile, professionals are finding it increasingly difficult to secure stable positions.\n\nThis will be a no-filter conversation about recruitment - the good, the bad, and the ugly. From the perspective of both recruiters and candidates, we'll dive into what's really going on in the job market today. With Phillip's candid approach, you can expect zero sugar-coating and plenty of real talk about what works (and what doesn't) in hiring.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to gain a broader perspective on the dynamics of IT talent acquisition and empower yourself with the knowledge to make informed decisions, whether you're hiring or seeking your next role.\n\nAt Bridging the Gap, we believe in the power of open collaboration and community-driven learning to democratize access to essential education.
