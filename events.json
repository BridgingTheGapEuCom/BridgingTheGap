Half British, half Polish, and living in Poland, Phillip brings a unique perspective on both the international and local recruitment landscapes.\n\nIn today's rapidly shifting job market, both companies and candidates are facing significant challenges. Companies struggle to source the best talent, often ending up with candidates who excel at navigating Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and processes rather than being the ideal fit. Meanwhile, professionals are finding it increasingly difficult to secure stable positions.\n\nThis will be a no-filter conversation about recruitment - the good, the bad, and the ugly. From the perspective of both recruiters and candidates, we'll dive into what's really going on in the job market today. With Phillip's candid approach, you can expect zero sugar-coating and plenty of real talk about what works (and what doesn't) in hiring.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity to gain a broader perspective on the dynamics of IT talent acquisition and empower yourself with the knowledge to make informed decisions, whether you're hiring or seeking your next role.\n\nAt Bridging the Gap, we believe in the power of open collaboration and community-driven learning to democratize access to essential education.

    "description": "Are you constantly grappling with the paradox of IT architecture? You have a vision for an elegant, perfect system (the desire), but you’re constrained by legacy debt, tight budgets, and shifting requirements (the limitation). Do you ever feel the unique psychological weight of constantly building for a future that doesn't yet exist?\n\nTune in to our next Live Stream: Architects Navigating the Human Condition, a special edition! We are thrilled to host renowned expert Mark Richards, architect, author, and founder of developertoarchitect.com, to help us unpack the challenges unique to the architect role.\n\nIn this session, we’ll move beyond diagrams and technical patterns to explore the human element of architecture. We will discuss:\n• The Cycle of Triumph and Failure: How to develop resilience and manage the emotional extremes of shipping a successful product versus a critical system failure.\n• The Burden of Foresight (Consciousness): Strategies for coping with the constant pressure of future-proofing and making today's decisions that impact tomorrow’s operations.\n• Making Order from Chaos: The psychological drive to simplify complexity and how architects can find meaning by connecting technical blueprints to clear, tangible business value.\n\nJoin us if you’re ready to acknowledge and conquer the shared, universal struggles of the IT Architect role, turning constraints into creative catalysts!",

Valeriia will be pulling back the curtain to show us how they've leveraged EDA to power the warehouse systems. This is your chance to hear about a real-world implementation, from the initial problem statement to the specific decisions that led to their current success.\n\nDon't miss out on this practical session where we’ll discuss the role of EDA in warehouse systems, as well as, the journey of implementing this approach, including the challenges, successes and the rationale behind key architectural decisions.",

Many companies are looking to escape platform lock-in by migrating from IPaaS technology vendors to open-source integration solutions or even just build interoperability capabilities from scratch. It sounds like a clear cost-saver, but are the hidden costs of such endeavor truly understood?\n\nIn line with our mission at Bridging the Gap to provide vendor-agnostic insight, we’re thrilled to host Brian Labelle, Enterprise Architect at Bribelle Business Solution Limited, for a crucial conversation that goes beyond the spreadsheet. We’ll be looking at how to approach such a migration and explain all the dependencies that reach way beyond technology and licenses.\n\nBrian will help us dissect:\n• The strategic drivers (beyond just licensing) pushing companies towards pure Java.\n• The critical challenges and hidden costs associated with this large-scale migration.\n• How to ensure you’re aware of all the costs before making the final decision.\n\nJoin the discussion!

We’ll focus not only on designing a good API but also on building a shared understanding of its purpose using tools from Domain-Driven Design!\n\nTune in to our next Live Stream: Collaborative Modelling and API definitions in the age of AI. Guiding us through the process will be Dr. Annegret Junker, Chief Software Architect @ codecentric AG, a specialist in collaborative modelling and API design. We’ll be exploring not only modelling, but also speeding up the process by using Generative AI to craft a ready-to-implement specification more quickly.\n\nThis session will provide a practical viewpoint, covering:\n• Building a shared understanding with Domain Storytelling and a Visual Glossary.\n• Modeling a domain system's internal and external interoperability using domain events and context mapping to outline the interactions between various system modules,\n• Generating OpenAPI specifications by using the modeling output as input for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nIf you want to build APIs that are clearer, more purposeful, and driven by collective domain knowledge, join us live!

    "description": "Most integration landscapes grow messy, siloed, and become hard to change. This course shows you how to design interoperability with purpose. Apply Domain-Driven Design to integrate architecture so your systems work together, scale with your organization, and stay aligned to your business needs.\n\nOrganisations often reinvent the wheel when connecting systems. Custom point-to-point solutions emerge, silos deepen, and technical decisions drift away from business intent. This results in unwanted complexity that slows delivery and limits agility.\n\nStrategic Integration Design with DDD equips your team to turn integration into a strategic capability. By combining collaborative modelling with proven integration patterns, you will learn how to design flows that serve business goals, create reusable assets instead of one-off fixes, and evaluate when larger transformation steps are needed. Along the way, you will see how interoperability follows organizational structure (Conway’s Law in action) and how reducing different kinds of coupling leads to systems that can evolve with the business.\n\nParticipants value this course because it gives names and theories for practices they already use informally, demystifies industry jargon and introduces practical tools for comparing trade-offs.\n\nFor who?\n• Solution & Integration Architects,\n• Staff/Principal Engineers,\n• Engineering Managers, Directors, and Business Analysts, Consultants.\n\nLearning outcomes\n\nWhat You’ll Learn\n• Elicit integration requirements with EventStorming: Quickly map business processes, events, and bounded contexts to uncover where systems must interoperate.\n• Depict flows with Domain Message Flow: Visualize how events, commands, and queries travel across systems, and match them to well established integration patterns.\n• Apply trade-off analysis: Use a structured tool to weigh integration options and choose with confidence.\n• Recognize maturity stages: Understand the complexities of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), and that they are not binary choices.\n• Reduce coupling: Identify different types of coupling, and learn how to balance them.\n• Demystify architecture styles: Place different approaches in context, clarifying what they solve and where their limits are.\n• Plan integrations purposefully: Design reusable solutions directly aligned with business needs, rather than ad-hoc fixes.\n\nWhy Attend?\n• Strategic clarity: Understand which integration approaches fit your context and how to explain trade-offs to stakeholders.\n• Shared language: Give teams a vocabulary to describe integration patterns and styles, reducing confusion and reliance on constantly misused buzzwords.\n• Direct applicability: Learn techniques & methods, which you can apply directly to your current business problems and system.\n• Organizational awareness: See how interoperability depends on the way teams are structured, and how to align system boundaries with business domains.\n• Future-proofing: Design integrations that remain flexible and reusable as your organization and technology landscape evolve.",

As systems are distributed and developed by different teams, we deal with different types of architectural styles, as well as differences in interoperability needs within and externally of those systems.\n\nFrom the perspective of an integration specialist there is one key area, where personally I get easily lost due to a completely different nature of the way these systems are designed: Frontends!
