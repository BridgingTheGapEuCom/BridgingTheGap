  <h2>The issue of “Integration”</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Working in any industry brings all sorts of terms and abbreviations that are specific to that
    particular industry or even specific to a narrow field of it. During our working day we more
    often use job specific jargon then we think, and that jargon when used outside of the industry
    context may be a cause of a lot of misunderstandings or even problems
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    That is exactly the case with Data Integration and Application Integration. Both of these terms
    have the word “integration” in them, which is commonly used by specialists of those two fields
    alone without the preceding word meaning their respective terms. Why is that a problem? People
    outside of that field mostly hear the word “integration” instead of the full term and because of
    that they tend to think that this is one and the same thing. To be honest even specialists in
    those fields make that mistake when they are not aware of the existence of the other field in
    IT. An application integration specialist might think: “Oh, data integration, yes, we move data
    from place to place, hence we integrate it! That is the same thing!”.
  </p>

  <p>
    This way they create a little bit of chaos and misunderstanding, that may or may not result in
    later organizational problems like lower budget, no willingness to invest in technology (because
    we already did invest so much in this area - the other area, because one was mistaken for the
    other), etc..
  </p>

  <h2>What is Data Integration?</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    So what actually is Data Integration and how does it differ from Application Integration? While
    researching the topic to give a complete answer we stumbled upon a very descriptive analogy:
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    “Consider a room where different puzzle pieces are scattered all around, each with a picture on
    it. Now, what do you do if you want to see the complete picture? You bring all those pieces
    together, connect them, and complete the puzzle, right?”
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Data integration is the process of combining and harmonizing data from multiple sources
    (multiple pieces from a puzzle) to provide a unified view (the complete puzzle). At least this
    is the short and simple definition. But what does that actually mean?
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The focus of data integration is to make data, which is scattered among various systems,
    accessed, transformed and delivered in a consistent and meaningful manner across the whole
    organization for Business Intelligence (BI), data analysis, or use by other applications and
    business processes. This typically involves data cleansing, transformation and synchronization.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means that the creators of Data Integration tools also provide certain capabilities to move
    data from sources and to consumers as this is often the requirement with customers that do not
    have their own application integration capabilities. This often involves setting up API
    connections, both hosting and calling, directly accessing databases over ODBC or JDBC
    connections.
  </p>

  <h2>What is application integration then?</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    As we already defined in the article
    <a href="/bridgingTheGap/articles/What_is_Application_Integration" target="_blank"
      >“What is Application Integration?”</a
    >
    - it is the strive to connect different applications into a larger ecosystem that functions as
    one and by that we mean it is the capability to provide the right data to the right place at the
    right time, where Application Integration defines how that data transfer should happen within
    those given parameters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Application integration tools, despite the main focus on connecting systems, are also capable of
    doing sophisticated data integration other than formatting or structurizing. While these
    capabilities are usually very handy in solving specific problems, our advice is simple - please
    do not do data integration in the application integration layer! Putting business logic over
    application integration platforms is usually not a good idea. Unless you are working closely
    with a good data architect and you are capable of documenting all of the transformations
    properly with the documentation being easily searchable and accessible, this is usually a
    problem as Application Integration Platforms are not considered to be business systems.
    Unfortunately, usually when data integration is done on the application integration tools, it is
    being done as a workaround to a problem, to be fixed later. As our experience shows it is nearly
    never fixed and remains in place, causing all sorts of maintenance issues, additional operations
    costs, further development problems, and serious production failures, with new releases that did
    not take this additional logic as a dependency to be tested.
  </p>

  <h2>The trade-offs</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Taking the above as it is, there is an overlap between data integration and application
    integration. To a certain extent it is true, as a lot of the data integration tools provide
    application integration capabilities that enable the access and delivery of data. On the other
    hand application integration technologies often also have specific data integration capabilities
    available. In that way they contribute to additional confusion as to what is the scope of this
    field.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the case of using data integration tools to facilitate application integration, as with all
    of the architecture questions, the answer to this problem would always be “it depends”. There
    are several factors which might be decisive whether or not the tool should handle application
    integration:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-7">
    <li>
      <b>Organization size</b> - if the organization is small, most of the time there is no budget
      to build a robust enterprise architecture with fancy features and proper division of
      responsibilities. In those cases “done is better than perfect”, as placing a highly mature
      architecture will probably not contribute to company growth and a bit too costly at this point
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>IT maturity</b> - if it is low, might contribute to additional complexity and make the
      maintenance of the IT landscape troublesome. In large environments adding another component
      may seem harmless, but will further contribute to overall complexity that is unstructured and
      hard to maintain, also called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" target="_blank"
        >“spaghetti architecture”</a
      >
      or a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Software_engineering_anti-patterns"
        target="_blank"
        >“big ball of mud”</a
      >, making it stiff and costly to maintain. In those cases a clear division of responsibilities
      would be beneficial
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Preexisting application integration platforms and capabilities</b> - if there are
      preexisting application integration tools available, this requires a validation, as to do they
      enable transport capabilities that are required by the data integration use cases (batch,
      on-demand, event driven). If the capabilities are sufficient, they should be used, rather than
      the ones provided by the data integration tools
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Use cases of the data integration tools</b> - depending on the uses case, whether it is an
      operational data hub, a business intelligence tool or ad hoc usage by business applications
      and processes, the capabilities may differ with applied tools, as also some easy
      transformations, like formatting or structurizing, may be done over the application
      integration and will be sufficient
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Architectural Oversight</h2>
  <p>
    As far as it is true that every company has a different structure, roles and especially the
    names for them, it doesn't really matter in terms of the scope of responsibilities. These can be
    divided into the responsibilities of application integration and data integration, which in a
    perfect world would fall under the respective responsibilities of an integration architect and a
    data architect. While, like with tools, a company may have both, none or one or the other of the
    architectural roles, there are a few helpful guidelines to establish proper oversight. These can
    be summarized by asking four key questions: what, where, when and how.
  </p>

  <h3>What?</h3>
  <p>
    There needs to be a common understanding of data objects and how they are supposed to be used,
    what are the edge cases for specific data points and rules for filtering them into specific
    scopes.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>What data objects are we working with?</li>
    <li>What is the business meaning of those data objects?</li>
    <li>What is the context of their use in a business process?</li>
    <li>What is the common meaning of these data objects in a specific business domain?</li>
    <li>What is the scope of the data object actually consumed?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Where?</h3>
  <p>
    The data objects in a complex environment need to have a clear origin and there needs to be a
    clear understanding as to who (what system) is the consumer of these data objects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where is the data created and stored?</li>
    <li>Where (what system) should the data be used?</li>
    <li>Is there a data multi-mastery conflict?</li>
    <li>Is the data split over several systems and needs to be merged?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When?</h3>
  <p>
    Knowing when along with what and where the data is used gives a full understanding of it in the
    business landscape, enabling the organization to provide proper data transports in a timely or
    even real-time manner based on actual needs.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When is the data used by the business?</li>
    <li>Is the data freshness an important feature?</li>
    <li>When should the data be moved, what triggers transport?</li>
    <li>When does it add value to the respective business domain?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How?</h3>
  <p>
    This is the underlying technical process of transporting data between systems, that involves
    data transformation (simple formatting over the application integration layer, or heavy changes
    over a data integration tool), orchestration as well as enrichment. This is when tools,
    protocols and formats should be discussed.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Can the data be classified as an event?</li>
    <li>Is it pulled on-demand?</li>
    <li>Should it be a batch transfer?</li>
    <li>What is the orchestration and enrichment needed?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>So what is the difference?</h2>
  <p>
    As stated, the difference between the fields of Data Integration and Application Integration can
    be easily distinguished on a logical level. The key problem lies in the fact that the tools used
    for both compensate in some way for the lack of the other field capabilities. This makes it very
    difficult to divide those capabilities clearly in a live environment, as it requires a specific
    architectural skill set in place, as well as high enough maturity. As the company and its IT
    landscape grow, it is worth understanding this logical division and to onboard proper tools for
    each field before the capability gap becomes a burden for the business.
