              I'm an Enterprise and Integration Architect with a passion for application integration
              and over a decade of specialized experience in the field. My journey began as a junior
              developer, who stumbled onto Application Integration by pure chance and stayed for the
              joy of learning.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-6">
              My expertise lies primarily in orchestration driven service-oriented architecture
              (ODSOA), although I've also delved into the realm of event-driven architecture (EDA)
              to broaden my professional toolkit. I've worked extensively with a myriad of
              integration platforms, including Tibco BusinessWorks 5.x and 6.x, Boomi, WebMethods,
              Mulesoft, Azure Integration Services, and WSO2, constantly adapting to the evolving
              landscape of integration technologies.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-6">
              I see the world of Application Integration as not just a profession but a passion. I
              believe it to be one of the most fascinating fields in IT, with endless possibilities
              for innovation and problem-solving. To further this belief, I actively try to
              contribute to helping others understand this field by creating whitepapers and
              training materials that explain complex integration concepts, empowering others to
              navigate this exciting domain with confidence.
