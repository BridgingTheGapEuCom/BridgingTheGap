# Bridging the gap

Welcome to Bridging the Gap, an open-source educational project aimed at closing the knowledge divide in the IT field of Application Integration. Our mission is to empower learners with comprehensive insights into application integration, providing them with definitions, examples, and integration patterns to navigate this intricate domain.

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, application integration plays a crucial role in ensuring seamless communication and functionality across diverse systems and platforms. However, despite its significance, formal education often overlooks this critical aspect, leaving aspiring professionals with limited understanding and resources.

Existing training programs in application integration tend to be technology vendor-centric, inherently biased towards specific platforms or solutions. Recognizing this limitation, we strive to offer a vendor-agnostic knowledge base accessible to anyone seeking to expand their expertise in this field. Our content is meticulously curated to provide a broader perspective, allowing learners to delve into various architectural styles and understand how application integration fits within them.

At Bridging the Gap, we believe in the power of open collaboration and community-driven learning. By fostering a platform where individuals can freely access a wealth of unbiased information, we aim to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in the realm of application integration.

Join us on this journey as we embark on a mission to democratize access to comprehensive education in application integration, empowering learners to navigate the complexities of modern IT with confidence and clarity.
