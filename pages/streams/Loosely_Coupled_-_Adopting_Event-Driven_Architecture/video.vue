  { startTime: 483.29, person: 'Fran', text: ' And there was nothing like OpenAPI for that.' },

    startTime: 493.41,
    person: 'Fran',

  },

    person: 'Fran',
    text: ' And when it says post or something else, it can say publish.'

    startTime: 508.11,
    person: 'Fran',

  },
  { startTime: 511.049, person: 'Fran', text: ' For code generation, not so much.' },

    startTime: 863.95,
    person: 'Fran',
    text: " But some people, as I said, like, some people also, including myself sometimes, because it's useful to talk about EBA all the time, if you send an action, a command, and expect a response over a broker, which is also possible, we sometimes also talk about these things as even-driven architecture."
  },
