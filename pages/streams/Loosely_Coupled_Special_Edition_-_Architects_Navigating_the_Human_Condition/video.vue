    text: ' Now, going back to the differentiator, so the why.'
  },
  {
    startTime: 549.92,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: " So just to repeat so it's a little clearer on the new mic now that we have is just because we're all experts in something in our field."
  },

    startTime: 562.24,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: " Whether you're an architect developer or any sort of technologist."
  },
  {
    startTime: 566.84,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: ' And this this whole human condition piece, the SOC skills, is what I see as one of the big differentiators to be able to differentiate yourself from all of your colleagues who are just probably as good as you technology-wise.'
  },
  { startTime: 585.48, person: 'Mark', text: ' So that is one of the differentiators I see.' },
  { startTime: 589.56, person: 'Mark', text: ' Differentiators.' },
  { startTime: 593.61, person: 'Karol', text: ' Okay, I would have a different why.' },
  { startTime: 596.57, person: 'Mark', text: ' Ah, okay.' },
  {
    startTime: 597.69,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " Coming from a perspective of a person who's neuroatypical and I do have autistic traits combined with ADHD, my why for these skills is because without them my life is just horrendously hard as an expert because I come across as too stubborn, too direct, or any other strong descriptor."
  },
  {
    startTime: 625.73,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' just understanding that sometimes I do come across like that.'
  },
  {
    startTime: 630.69,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' First of all, that takes self-awareness, which is something everybody should have.'
  },
  { startTime: 635.93, person: 'Karol', text: " It doesn't happen always." },
  { startTime: 637.47, person: 'Karol', text: " It's a trained skill." },
  {
    startTime: 639.73,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " Also, with having that self-awareness, how to work around those situations that are problematic, it's a skill in itself."
  },
  { startTime: 651.53, person: 'Karol', text: ' To have those skillset needed to navigate those.' },
  {
    startTime: 657.09,
    person: 'Karol',

    startTime: 690.23,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' It was an absolutely amazing quality of the talk.'
  },
  {
    startTime: 694.07,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' But then the QA came and the first question that went from the audience was Andrew, you told us about the second hardest problem of software architecture.'

  {
    startTime: 704.65,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " You didn't say anything about the first hardest problem."
  },
  {
    startTime: 707.49,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " I was holding the mic and I stood for a second on the stage and was like, oh, yeah, you're right."

    startTime: 716.53,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " As a human, it's not a problem in the software architecture."
  },
  {
    startTime: 719.43,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' So, having those soft skills and navigating the human condition is actually solving the biggest problem in software architecture.'
  },
  {
    startTime: 728.73,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' And this is also, why is this a problem in software architecture?'
  },
  {
    startTime: 732.49,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: ' Because software, at least in my opinion, software architecture and just designing and building software without a purpose, in our case, most of the times a business purpose, because obviously some people build it for fun or for home improvement, whatever.'
  },
  { startTime: 750.43, person: 'Karol', text: " But that's also a purpose in that sense." },
  {
    startTime: 752.29,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " So, building software without a purpose basically means that it's just art for the art of it."
  },
  {
    startTime: 761.77,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " It doesn't an art form, and in all the context that we are architects, developers, niche specialists, whatever that may be, we're always building the software with a purpose of facilitating some sort of a business."
  },
  { startTime: 779.91, person: 'Karol', text: " Yeah, that's a good point." },
  {
    startTime: 782.71,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " And without the skill to navigate the complexities of human interactions, all business is basically human interactions and we're basically yeah, yeah."
  },

  {
    startTime: 794.59,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: " You remind me with your why question of another one, but it's another quote."
  },
  { startTime: 801.57, person: 'Mark', text: " And it's from Gerald Weinberg." },
  { startTime: 803.57, person: 'Mark', text: ' And he quoted way a long time ago.' },

  {
    startTime: 810.17,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: " He said, quote, no matter what the problem is, it's a people problem."
  },
  {
    startTime: 815.29,
    person: 'Mark',
    text: " And so that's another good why piece because he was right."
  },
  { startTime: 820.87, person: 'Mark', text: ' He was right.' },
  {
    startTime: 822.19,
    person: 'Mark',

  {
    startTime: 863.15,
    person: 'Karol',
    text: " That's the very crucial thing to begin with is the why why do we even want to navigate because I remember my juniors the difference between our experiences is quite a long one because we have 42 years of experience in IT."
