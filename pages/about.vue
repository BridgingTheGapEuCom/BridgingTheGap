              I'm an Enterprise and Integration Architect with a passion for application integration
              and over a decade of specialized experience in the field. My journey began as a junior
              developer, who stumbled onto Application Integration by pure chance and stayed for the
              joy of learning.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-6">
              My expertise lies primarily in API-Led Architecture, although I've also delved into
              the realm of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) to broaden my professional toolkit. I've
              worked extensively with a myriad of integration platforms, including Tibco
              BusinessWorks 5.x and 6.x, Boomi, WebMethods, Mulesoft, Azure Integration Services,
              and WSO2, constantly adapting to the evolving landscape of integration technologies.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-6">
              I see the world of Application Integration as not just a profession but a passion. I
              believe it to be one of the most fascinating fields in IT, with endless possibilities
              for innovation and problem-solving. To further this belief, I actively try to
              contribute to helping others understand this field by creating whitepapers and
              training materials that explain complex integration concepts, empowering others to
              navigate this exciting domain with confidence.

            your digital realm, wielding my staff of code with the wisdom of a thousand sages. From
            the humble beginnings of coding in caves to now surfing the binary waves of innovation,
            I've journeyed through the ages of technology. It's like I've embarked on an epic quest
            through the realms of integration, slaying dragons of data inconsistency and forging
            alliances between disparate systems.

          <p class="indent-6">
            With background in electronics and actual experience in turning an idea into a
            manufactured device, I also studied IT management and most of my career was in IT. I
            worked as developer, project manager, systems analyst, solution and integration
            architect and as a business analyst.
          </p>
          <p class="indent-6">
            Alternating between analyst and architect roles, I worked for telco, banks, insurer,
            airline, goods manufacturers and retailers, utilities and more. I have experience as
            employee, consultant and even as company owner (UBO) - which gives good, multiple points
            of view insight into business around IT.
          </p>
          <p class="indent-6">
            My expertise is in understanding the context of IT projects and figuring out, what has
            to be done, and more importantly, what should not be done. That involves modeling the
            business processes, system-to-system and system-to-user interactions; understanding the
            data and mapping it between domains and systems. I see integration as next level of IT
            systems evolution, the level which brings its own challenges and promises. I&#39;m eager
            to help solving the challenges to take the promised profit.
