    <h2>Who We Share Your Data With</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your data with following third parties under the following circumstances or as

    <h2>Our Policy Concerning Children</h2>
    <p>
      BtG provides educational materials related to IT software architecture, and does not collect
      any payments. We do believe there is no limit to the age as long as anyone is interested in
      software architecture, and we do not collect the age of the users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, parents who believe that BtG may have collected personal data from a child under law
      age limits required for freely sharing their own personal data in a given country may submit a
      request that it be removed to BtG email:
      <a
        class="link text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 hover:text-black dark:hover:text-white"
        href="mailto:info@bridgingthegap.eu.com"
        >info@bridgingthegap.eu.com</a
      >. Note, that due to the very limited set of data collected by BtG, in such a case Parent will
      have to prove that the email requested to be removed from the BtG database is used by the
      child for which they are parent or guardian. This procedure was put into place to prevent
      impersonation attacks on BtH users.
    </p>
    <h2>Modifications to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      From time to time, we may update this Privacy Policy. If we make any material change to it, we
      will notify you via email, by update posted in the web page. Unless stated otherwise,
      modifications will become effective on the day they are posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As permitted by applicable law, if you continue to use BtG or any of its services after the
      effective date of any change, then your access and/or use will be deemed an acceptance of (and
      agreement to follow and be bound by) the revised Privacy Policy. The revised Privacy Policy
      supersedes all previous Privacy Policies.
